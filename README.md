Model 3: Impact of the financial reporting quality on investment efficiency
InvEffit+1 =β0+β1FRQit+βnControl Variables it+εit

Dependent variable (InvEffit+1) represents over or under-investment which is the absolute residual of regression Model 1. The absolute residual of Model (1) is inverse measure of investment efficiency, meaning the lower absolute residual shows the higher investment efficiency. However, we multiple the absolute residual of model (1) by –1, representing the higher absolute residual is higher investment efficiency. (Biddle et al., 2009; Chen et al. 2011). 
(FRQ) representing independent variable which is the residuals value from the regression model (2) are discretionary accruals. First, we calculate the absolute values of discretionary accruals, and then multiply the absolute values of discretionary accruals by –1 as a proxy for financial reports quality. Therefore, higher values of FRQ represent higher financial reports quality. (Chen et al. 2011)
(Size) is firm size which is natural logarithm of total assets. (Age) is firm age which is natural logarithm of the firm in years. (Tangibility Asset) is measured by the ratio of tangible fixed assets to total assets. (Cash surplus) measured by the ratio of cash to total assets. β is a constant term. ε it is a random error.

3.3 Hypotheses
To test the study objectives, the following hypotheses are formulated:
H1:There is no impact of the financial reporting quality on the investment efficiency at the level (α ≤ 0.05) in companies 
H2: There is no effect of cash surplus on investment efficiency in companies at (α ≤ 0.05). 
H3: There is no impact of the tangible asset on the investment efficiency in companies at (α ≤ 0.05).
H4: There is no impact on the size on investment in companies at (α ≤ 0.05). 
H5: There is no impact of the age on investment efficiency in companies at (α ≤ 0.05).
